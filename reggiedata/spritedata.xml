<!-- Feel free to research the Timing Offset value for information on what it does. There's a few options. It could be a Set ID sort of matching that causes all Skewers of a specific set to be loaded in when any from the set is loaded into memory. If all Skewers are loaded into memory for timing purposes from the start of a level, it could be a fractional offset causing it to simply shift the starting time. It could also be a flat delay rather than a fractional one. Confirmation on its function would be nice. Load yourself up a starman and low zoom level and see what happens across a long stage. For the most part, keep your Skewers otherwise identical on their settings, but also test using a single "Timing Offset" and see what happens when differences between them are added. Or, just dig around in ASM. Your choice. Edit 140-142 and maybe 398-399 with the same findings. -->

The water will then sink this many blocks, respecting any delays. After waiting for the delay at the bottom, the water surface will not rise again. Not exactly. Instead, it will 'skip' the rising part and 'jump' to immediately to the top. Additionally, using this with events will cause the water to rise, instead of falling. [ON] But the starting point is the same higher distance. The difference is that the water rises continuously as long as the event is enabled. [Endless Rising] If it is disabled, [OFF after ON] the water surface will 'jump' back to where it started and remain there until the event is re-enabled.
